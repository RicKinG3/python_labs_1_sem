Wise men speak because they have something to say;
fools because they have to say something. Chop your own wood and 
it will warm you twice. I don’t care what you think 
about me. I dont think about you at all. we
you like, otherwise you'll be forced to just like what you get. In the
End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.
